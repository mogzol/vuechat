# VueChat (WIP)

A simple internet chat app written in Vue/Vuex.

## Running VueChat

First, enter the server folder and run this command to start the WebSocket server

```
npm run start
```

And additionally enter the client folder and run this command to start the Vue development server

```

Then navigate to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser to see the app. You can open this page multiple times to log in as different users simultanously.
